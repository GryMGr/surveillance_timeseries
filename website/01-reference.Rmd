# Definitions and Scenarios

## Panel Data

Panel data is a set of data with measurements repeated at equally spaced points. For example, number of influenza cases recorded every day, or every week, or every year would be considered panel data. The number of influenza cases on Jan 31, Feb 3, and Nov 21 in 2018 would not be considered panel data.

## Autocorrelation

When you have panel data, autocorrelation is the correlation between subsequent observations. For example, if you have daily observations, then the 1 day autocorrelation is the correlation between observations 1 day apart, and likewise the 2 day autocorrelation is the correlation between observations 2 days apart.

## Scenarios

In this course we will consider three scenarios where we have multiple observations for each geographical area:

- Panel data: One geographical area, with/without autocorrelation
- Not panel data: Multiple geographical areas
- Panel data: Multiple geographical areas, with/without autocorrelation

Note, the following scenario can be covered by standard regression models:

- Multiple geographical areas, one time point/observation per geographical area

## Useful Code

This code is used to calculate prediction intervals. In its most basic form it is:

$$
95\% \text{ CI} = \text{sample average} \pm 1.96 \times \text{sample standard deviation} \sqrt{ 1 + 1 / n}
$$
However, due to the skewness of the count data, we often choose to use a `2/3s transformation`.
